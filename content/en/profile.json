  "description": "I'm a three-year-experienced backend developer, working with web applications and APIs. Python (pretty much Django), PHP (Laravel), and a bit of C# (.NET) are my areas of expertise, building systems that are stable and just work. I've spent ample time designing databases - PostgreSQL, MySQL - and making sure they just work, even under heavy datasets. I've worked with integrating apps with external APIs like Bitrix24, AmoCRM, Telegram, and OpenAI to deliver great features. I've also created things like real-time data processing, websockets, and async tasks to ensure everything is efficient and user-friendly. On the DevOps side, I've set up servers, used Docker for containerization, and handled automated deployment with GitHub Actions. I've also used tools like Nginx, Grafana, and Prometheus for infrastructure management. On my free time I enjoy making games in C# with Unity.",
